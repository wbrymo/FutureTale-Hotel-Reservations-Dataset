# 🏨 FutureTale Hotel Reservation Data Analysis

Analyzing booking patterns, cancellations, and customer behavior to help FutureTale Hotel improve revenue forecasting and reduce cancellation rates using data analytics and visualization.

# Project Overview

This project investigates reservation and cancellation data from FutureTale Hotel, a fictional hospitality business experiencing a surge in booking cancellations between 2017 – 2018.
The goal was to uncover the key drivers of cancellations, develop predictive insights, and recommend strategies to optimize revenue and minimize booking losses.

The dataset contained thousands of booking records with details on room types, guest demographics, meal plans, market segments, and reservation lead times.
Through extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization, I identified behavioral and operational patterns contributing to high cancellation rates.

# Objectives

Analyze booking trends and identify patterns linked to reservation cancellations.

Compare behaviors of canceled vs. non-canceled bookings (e.g., lead time, room type, customer type).

Recommend data-driven solutions to minimize cancellations and improve occupancy forecasting.

Provide actionable insights to inform pricing, deposit, and retention policies.

# Tools, Libraries & Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

Pandas, NumPy — data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn — data visualization and pattern discovery

Jupyter Notebook — analysis and documentation

Excel — supplementary visualization and validation

Techniques:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation Analysis, Feature Engineering, Statistical Inference

# Workflow / Steps to Execute
1️⃣ Data Collection

The dataset includes booking records with features such as:
Hotel, IsCanceled, LeadTime, ArrivalDate, StaysInWeekendNights, StaysInWeekNights, Adults, Children, Babies, Meal, Country, MarketSegment, ReservedRoomType, DepositType, CustomerType, ADR (Average Daily Rate).

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values for children, country, and agent columns.

Converted date columns into a proper datetime format.

Verified data integrity and removed invalid entries (e.g., zero guests).

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed and visualized data to address key business questions:

What percentage of bookings were canceled?

Which room types and meal plans are most affected by cancellations?

Does lead time (days between booking and check-in) correlate with cancellation probability?

How do deposit types or market segments influence cancellations?

Key observations from visualizations:

City hotels had higher cancellation rates than resort hotels.

Canceled bookings had significantly longer lead times.

Customers booking through online travel agents (OTAs) were most likely to cancel.

No-deposit bookings showed the highest churn rate.

4️⃣ Correlation Analysis

Found a strong positive correlation between lead time and cancellation probability.

ADR (Average Daily Rate) correlated moderately with cancellations, suggesting pricing sensitivity.

5️⃣ Feature Engineering

Derived categorical features such as “Booking Lead Category” (Short, Medium, Long).

Segmented customer types (Transient, Contract, Group) for behavioral comparison.

# Results & Key Insights
Insight	Observation
Overall Cancellation Rate	-------------------37% of all bookings were canceled — a critical revenue leakage.

High-Risk Segment	---------------------------Customers booking far in advance (> 90 days) canceled more often.

Hotel Type Effect	---------------------------City hotels saw higher cancellations than resort hotels.

Deposit Type Impact	-------------------------No-deposit bookings had 65% higher cancellation risk.

Channel Influence	---------------------------Online travel agents contributed to the majority of cancellations.

Customer Type	-------------------------------“Transient” customers (one-time guests) canceled more than loyal or contract guests.
# Business Recommendations

Advance Booking Management:
Introduce flexible pricing and prepayment options for long lead-time bookings.

Deposit Policy Revision:
Enforce small deposits for no-show-prone segments to discourage speculative bookings.

Customer Segmentation:
Offer loyalty rewards for repeat or contract customers to improve retention.

OTA Optimization:
Collaborate with online agencies to introduce stricter cancellation terms.

Dynamic Forecasting:
Use historical cancellation data to optimize room availability and pricing strategy.

# Business Impact

Improved the hotel’s understanding of booking behavior, enabling data-driven forecasting.

Recommended strategies projected to reduce cancellation rates by 15–20%.

Enhanced marketing and revenue management decisions through analytical insights.

Provided a data-centric framework for evaluating customer segments and policies.
